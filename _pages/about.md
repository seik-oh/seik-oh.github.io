I'm Seik Oh, a CS PhD student focused on **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Learning Science & Technology**. I design interfaces that people can **learn quickly and keep using**—by blending **qualitative research** (interviews, usability tests) with **quantitative data** (behavioral metrics, error rates). My sweet spot is the handoff from **research → prototype → insight-backed product decisions**.

#### What I'm working on

- **Interactive data visualization (ContAQT):** turning multi-pollutant air-quality data into clear, actionable visuals.
- **Accessibility-first platform redesign:** Figma-led UI/UX updates for users with ADHD; deployed to 100+ beta users.
- **NASA SUITS (AR & rover interfaces):** mission-critical flows tested at Johnson Space Center.
- **SpaceOver (iOS):** multisensory app using spatial audio & haptics for Blind/Visually Impaired users to provide astronomical experiences.

#### How I work

- Mixed-methods **UX research** → study plans, scripts, synthesis, and concise reports.
- **UX engineering** → rapid prototyping (Figma, React, programming) and lightweight instrumentation for learning what works.
- **Accessibility & learning design** → patterns that improve onboarding, comprehension, and retention.

#### Toolkits

Figma, React, Unity, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, TypeScript, Swift/SwiftUI, R, Git/GitHub

#### Fun facts

I've played the Korean traditional instrument called _haegum_ for 2 years.
I've played rugby for my school when I was in the UK.
I love to cook food!
