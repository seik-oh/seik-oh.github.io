I'm Seik Oh, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Jessica Roberts. My journey into Human-Computer Interaction began during my undergraduate studies in South Korea, where I first discovered how technology could transform learning experiences.


#### Current Research Focus

My recent work has been contributing to **ContAQT**, an interactive data visualization tool that transforms complex multi-pollutant air quality data into clear, actionable insights. This project explores how design rinciples can make environmental data more accessible and understandable for public audiences.

I'm also conducting research for the **Summer Camp Data Literacy Program** for K-12 students, a program that creates hands-on experiences to teach data literacy through interactive visualizations and real-world applications.

#### Research Approach

I believe in bridging the gap between research and practice. My methodology combines:
- **Qualitative research** (interviews, usability studies) to understand user needs
- **Quantitative analysis** (behavioral metrics, error rates) to measure impact
- **Rapid prototyping through design thinking** to test ideas quickly and iteratively
