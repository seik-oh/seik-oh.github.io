I'm Seik Oh, a CS PhD student focused on **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Learning Science & Technology**. I research and design interfaces that people can **learn quickly and keep using** by blending **qualitative research** (interviews, usability tests) with **quantitative data** (behavioral metrics, error rates). My sweet spot is the handoff from **research → prototype → insight-backed decisions**.

#### What I'm working on

- **Interactive data visualization (ContAQT):** turning multi-pollutant air-quality data into clear, actionable visuals.

- **Summer Camp Data Literacy Program:** Program for K-12 students to learn about data literacy.

<br/>

#### Major Projects I've worked on

- **Accessibility-first platform redesign (Gearshift Fellowship):** Figma-led UI/UX updates for users with ADHD.

- **NASA SUITS (AR interface & rover automation):** Mission-critical flows tested at Johnson Space Center.

- **SpaceOver (App):** Multisensory app using spatial audio & haptics for Blind/Visually Impaired users to provide astronomical experiences.

<!-- #### How I work

- Mixed-methods **UX research** → study plans, scripts, synthesis, and concise reports.

- **UX engineering** → rapid prototyping (Figma, React, programming) and lightweight instrumentation for learning what works.

- **Accessibility & learning design** → patterns that improve onboarding, comprehension, and retention. -->
